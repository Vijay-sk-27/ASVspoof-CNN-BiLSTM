CNN + BiLSTM based Fake Audio Detection using MFCC features.

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning based fake audio (spoofed speech) detection system.
MFCC features are extracted from audio signals and classified using a CNN + BiLSTM network.

## Features
- MFCC feature extraction
- CNN for spatial feature learning
- BiLSTM for temporal dependency modeling
- MATLAB implementation
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC, and EER

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Place dataset in the specified folder
3. Run:
   newvj2.m
